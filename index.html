      <p>Apollo 11 (July 16-24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong" alt="link to Neil Armstrong wiki page"
          style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Neil Armstrong</a> and lunar module pilot <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin" alt="link to Buzz Aldrin wiki page"
          style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Buzz Aldrin</a> formed the American crew that
        landed the Apollo Lunar
        Module
        Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar
        surface
        six
        hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They
        spent
        about
        two
        and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of
        lunar
        material
        to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)"
          alt="link to Michael Collins wiki page" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Michael
          Collins</a> flew the Command Module Columbia alone
        in
        lunar
        orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on
        the
        lunar
        surface, at a site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing, before lifting off to rejoin
        Columbia
        in
        lunar orbit.</p><br>

      <p>Apollo 11 was <a href="https://youtu.be/ViNcBQ8cDA0?t=30" title="Video of Saturn V launch"
          style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">launched</a> by a Saturn V rocket from
        Kennedy
        Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on
        July
        16
        at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo
        spacecraft
        had
        three
        parts: a command module (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_module_Columbia"
          style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">CM</a>) with a cabin for the three
        astronauts,
        the only part that returned to
        Earth; a
        service module (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_module" style="text-decoration: none;"
          target="_blank">SM</a>), which supported
        the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen,
        and
        water; and a lunar module (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module"
          style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">LM</a>) that
        had two stagesâ€”a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an
        ascent
        stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.</p><br>

      <p>After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the
        spacecraft
        from
        it
        and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into
        Eagle
        and
        landed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=196Stk10Yjw&ab_channel=yougotmiles"
          title="Video of Sea Of Tranquility" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Sea Of
          Tranquility</a> on July 20. The astronauts used Eagle's ascent stage to lift off
        from
        the
        lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they
        performed
        the
        maneuvers that propelled Columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back
        to
        Earth.
        They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight
        days
        in
        space.</p><br>

      <p>Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience.
        He
        described
        the event as "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively proved
        US victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national
        goal
        proposed
        in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, <a href="https://youtu.be/GmN1wO_24Ao?t=101"
          title="Video of JFK giving speech" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">"I believe
          this Nation should commit
          itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and
          returning him safely to the Earth."</a> </p>
